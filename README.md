# CreditCardFraudDetection
Fraud Detection System:

A machine learning-based system to detect fraudulent transactions in the creditcard.csv dataset. This project focuses on handling class imbalance, training robust models, and providing actionable insights for fraud prevention.

Key Features:

Class Imbalance Handling: Used SMOTE to balance the dataset.

Models Trained:
##### Supervised: Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression
##### Unsupervised: Isolation Forest, Autoencoders

Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.

Best Model: Random Forest (ROC-AUC: 97%+).

Feature Importance: Visualized key features driving predictions
#### Results:

Achieved 97%+ ROC-AUC with Random Forest.

Balanced precision and recall for fraud detection.

Explored unsupervised methods for detecting emerging fraud patterns.

Dataset:
The dataset used is creditcard.csv, which contains anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.
